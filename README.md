# GenshinProgressionHelper

The Genshin Progression Helper is a small .Net MAUI application, to help to plan your daily grind in the game Genshin Impact. This application is my first shot in trying out the new .Net MAUI multiplatform Framework.
On the first start-up the application takes about 30 - 90 seconds, because it needs to download the data for all the characters and weapons from an web-api. The used api is https://github.com/theBowja/genshin-db.
The application is fully tested on Windows 10 and Android. IOS and macOS are not fully tested, because of the lack of equipment.
